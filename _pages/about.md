I am currently a Doctoral Student at NECSTLab, working in the Imaging Research Team. 
My research concentrates on Biomedical Computer Vision and addresses the challenge of image analysis in end-to-end image-guided biopsies. 

Although the rise of Deep Learning (DL) has created many novel algorithms for medical image analysis, various image dimensionality scales and modalities, the high intra- and low inter-class variance, and the lack of annotated datasets have maintained high the need for specialized algorithms to optimize the image analysis performance during image-guided biopsies. In this context, the framework I am working on streamlines each phase of the biopsy process, from patient-level deformable image registration to histopathology and micro-Computed Tomography image processing specializing DL models at the algorithmic level. To this end, my research intends to overcome the presented challenges by implementing tools for image registration for large tissue deformations and style transfer, fine-grained image classification, semi-supervised image segmentation, and radiology-to-pathology image integration. 

The proposed solution will allow users to explore complete procedures and individual phases, ultimately supporting diagnosis and patient care. This research strives to bridge the gap between medical image analysis demands and current DL capabilities, contributing to enhanced healthcare outcomes and advancing medical technology.
